# VIRS
## Describtion 
The Visual Response Simulator | ViRS | is an agent-based modeling project designed to explore
and visualize how disease dynamics and social behaviors interact over space and time.Originating 
as an individual thesis project at the Harvard Graduate School of Design,ViRS is now a collaborative,
cross-disciplinary research effort at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.This particular product from
ViRS is a spatially abstract COVID-19 transmission study model.It intends to explore the potential level
of impact non-pharmaceutical public health interventions have on containing and stopping a COVID-19 
outbreak within a population of agents.
